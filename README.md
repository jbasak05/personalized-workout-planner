Generative Al for Personalized Workout/Calisthenics Routines  Concept: Instead of generic fitness plans, it learns from body type + goals -> generates progressive weekly workout schedules with exercise variations.


🏋️ AI Personalized Calisthenics CoachProject OverviewThis project is a web application that leverages Generative AI to create personalized, progressive weekly calisthenics (bodyweight) workout routines. Instead of generic fitness plans, the system generates custom schedules based on the user's body type, fitness goals, and experience level.The application is built using a standard Python web stack, making it robust and easy to deploy.Key FeaturesPersonalization: AI tailors the workout plan based on three key user inputs.Progressive Routine: Generates a structured, multi-day weekly schedule.Web Interface: Simple, responsive frontend built with HTML and Tailwind CSS.Secure API Handling: Uses the .env file and python-dotenv for secure storage of the API key.💻 Technical StackComponentTechnologyPurposeBackend FrameworkPython 3.xCore language for application logic.Web ServerFlaskLightweight web framework for handling routes and requests.Generative AIOpenAI API (gpt-3.5-turbo)Model used to generate the structured workout routine.API Key Securitypython-dotenvLoads the API key securely from the .env file.FrontendHTML, Tailwind CSSUser interface and styling for a modern, mobile-friendly experience.Data Handlingpython-markdownUsed in the backend to safely convert the AI's Markdown table output into HTML for display.🚀 Setup and Installation GuideFollow these steps precisely to get the application running on your local machine.PrerequisitesPython 3.9+ installed.Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed.An OpenAI API Key.1. Project StructureEnsure your project folder has this exact structure:/ai_fitness_coach
    |-- app.py             (The Python backend logic)
    |-- .env               (To store your API key)
    |-- requirements.txt   (Lists all necessary Python packages)
    |-- /templates
        |-- index.html     (The web interface/frontend)
2. Configure API KeyCreate a file named .env in the root of your project folder.Paste your OpenAI API Key inside, using the specific variable name OPENAI_API_KEY:OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_OPENAI_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"
3. Setup Virtual Environment and DependenciesThis step is critical to isolate your project's libraries.Open the Terminal in VS Code (Terminal > New Terminal).Create the environment:python -m venv venv
Activate the environment:Windows (PowerShell): .\venv\Scripts\activatemacOS / Linux: source venv/bin/activate(You must see (venv) at the start of your terminal prompt.)Install dependencies: Use the requirements.txt file to install all necessary packages:pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the ApplicationIn the same active terminal (where you see (venv)), run the main application file:python app.py
The terminal will display the local server URL, typically: http://127.0.0.1:5000/.Open your web browser and navigate to this URL to use the application.🛑 How to Stop the ServerTo stop the Flask application, go back to the terminal where it is running and press Ctrl + C.
